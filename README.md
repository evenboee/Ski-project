Project case: `https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/idatg2204/idatg2204-2021/-/wikis/The-Project-Case`

Developed using **PHP 8.0**

# Known to be missing:
- DB users. Only one implemented. Idea is roughly the same for other users as well
- URI `order/{state}/{id}` does not enforce flow of states (new->open->skis-available->ready)

# Setting up project

- Requires XAMPP, git, Composer, Windows

## Cloning repository
- Assuming you have git installed
- Go into the folder you want
- Run `git clone https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/idatg2204/idatg2204-2021-workspace/amundhel/db-project.git`

## Running deployment script

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Running this script will overwrite the .htaccess, any files in the xampp folder htdocs\api\v1 and any database named db_project5276.**

After running the script the API should be working.

### Before running setup.bat

- Run xampp and start the services **Apace** and **MySQL**.
- If xampp is not located in `C:\xampp`; this needs to be updated in the setup.bat script (line 4).
- If your **MySQL** server does not have "root" as username and "" as password; this need to be updated in the script

## Running tests
- Run command `php vendor/bin/codecept run`
