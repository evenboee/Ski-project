References to others work are there to credit the source not to pass guilt.

Group members take full responsibility for any error in borrowed code.

Inspiration for architecture: `https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/runehj/sample-rest-api-project`

Project case: `https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/idatg2204/idatg2204-2021/-/wikis/The-Project-Case`

Developed using **PHP 8.0**

# Known to be missing:
- DB users. Only one implemented. Idea is roughly the same for other users as well
- URI `order/{state}/{id}` does not enforce flow of states (new->open->skis-available->ready)

# Setting up project

- Requires XAMPP, git, Composer, Windows

## Cloning repository
- Assuming you have git installed
- Go into the folder you want
- Run `git clone https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/idatg2204/idatg2204-2021-workspace/amundhel/db-project.git`

## Running deployment script

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Running this script will overwrite the .htaccess, any files in the xampp folder htdocs\api\v1 and any database named db_project5276.**

The setup script **setup.bat** can be found in */setup*.

Run the script and after that the API should be working.

### Before running setup.bat

- Run xampp and start the services **Apace** and **MySQL**.
- If xampp is not located in `C:\xampp`; this needs to be updated in the setup.bat script (line 4).
- If your **MySQL** server does not have "root" as username and "" as password; this need to be updated in the script


# Using the API

The [API design](https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/idatg2204/idatg2204-2021-workspace/amundhel/db-project/-/blob/master/documents/API_design.pdf) can be used as instructions on using the API.

For each endpoint you need to add a cookie for to your request.

## Adding a cookie to request in postman

1. Click the **cookies** button under the send button used to send a request
1. Add a domain. It can be called **localhost**
1. Add a cookie with the key **auth_token** and value corresponding to the token of the endpoint you want to access
