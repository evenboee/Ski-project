Main inspiration for structure: `https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/runehj/sample-rest-api-project`

Project case: `https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/idatg2204/idatg2204-2021/-/wikis/The-Project-Case`

Developed using **PHP 8.0**

# Known to be missing:
- DB users. Only one implemented partly. Idea is roughly the same for other users as well
- URI `order/{state}/{id}` does not enforce flow of states (new->open->skis-available)
- Proper return value for uri `rep/order`
- API tests
- Defining test cases

# Assumptions
- Department of employee in project disctiption is interpereted to be synnonymous with role (i.e. customer representative or storekeeper)

# Notes
- Physical and logical models for Employees and Customers does not fully reflect conceptual model. The resoning is to keep track of employee and employee numbers to ensure they are unique even across different types of employees.

- Click plus sign and click + and select `Local or mounted folder` to create new server
- In field folder add the absolute path to xampp/htdocs
- For web server URL add `http://localhost`
- Navigate to mappings window
- For the field local path select absolute path to root folder of the project
- For deployment path add `api\v1`
- For web path add `/api/v1`
- Optional: Navigate to excluded paths and add local paths to setup, tests, .gitignore, README.md, runner.php
- Move `.htacces` in the *setup* folder to `xampp/htdocs`
